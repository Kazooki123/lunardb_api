# [DEPRECATED!!!] LUNARDB API SYSTEM

⚠️!!!THIS REPO/PROJECT IS DEPRECATED IS NOW NO LONGER MAINTAINED,
LUNARDB USES `CROW` FOR THE API SYSTEM THAT USES C++!!!⚠️

This is the **Source Code** for the API System of LunarDB by using **Go**

Can be hosted in a **Docker Container.**

## How it Works?

First off, everything runs in a **single** `main.go` file so it is basically a one-size-fits-all API system
thanks to Go and its type structure and safety.

It uses **Nginx** for hosting it as a server when launched.

Any other Go files are just experiment files and will be **tested** in the future to IMPORT it in `main.go`
